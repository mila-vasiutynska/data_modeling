    "## Table Schema Design Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "In Apache Cassandra, we design tables based on the queries we need to run. The primary key structure is critical for performance. The primary key consists of a partition key (which determines data distribution) and optional clustering columns (which determine sort order within a partition).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Table 1: `session_songs`\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose is to retrieve artist, song title, and song length for a specific session and item position.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Key:**\n",
    "- **Partition Key:** `sessionId` - This is used as the partition key because Query 1 filters on `sessionId = 338`. By using `sessionId` as the partition key, all songs for a given session are stored together on the same node, enabling efficient retrieval.\n",
    "- **Clustering Column:** `itemInSession` - This serves as a clustering column to ensure uniqueness (no two songs can have the same sessionId and itemInSession) and provides ordering within the partition, allowing us to efficiently retrieve a specific item in the session sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Design:**\n",
    "- Query 1 filters by both `sessionId` AND `itemInSession`, making `(sessionId, itemInSession)` an ideal composite primary key.\n",
    "- Data is distributed by session across the cluster, and within each partition, rows are sorted by item position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Table 2: `user_session_songs`\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose is to retrieve artist, song title, and user name for a specific user and session, sorted by item in session.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Key:**\n",
    "- **Partition Key:** `(userId, sessionId)` - This is a composite partition key because Query 2 filters on both `userId = 10` AND `sessionId = 182`. Using both columns as the partition key ensures that all songs for a specific user-session combination are co-located on the same node, optimizing query performance.\n",
    "- **Clustering Column:** `itemInSession` - This clustering column ensures uniqueness and provides natural ordering by song sequence within the partition. When multiple rows share the same partition key, Cassandra automatically sorts them by the clustering column, which aligns with the requirement to sort songs by `itemInSession`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Design:**\n",
    "- The two-column partition key efficiently handles the query's filter criteria, grouping related data together.\n",
    "- The clustering column sorts results by item in session without requiring a separate `ORDER BY` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Table 3: `song_users`\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose to retrieve all user names who listened to a specific song.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Key:**\n",
    "- **Partition Key:** `song` - This is the partition key because Query 3 filters by `song = 'All Hands Against His Own'`. All users who listened to a specific song are stored in the same partition, enabling efficient retrieval.\n",
    "- **Clustering Column:** `userId` - This clustering column ensures uniqueness (a user is listed only once per song in the partition) and provides efficient secondary sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Design:**\n",
    "- Query 3 filters exclusively on song name, making `song` the natural partition key.\n",
    "- Using `userId` as a clustering column prevents duplicate entries for the same user-song combination and maintains data organization.\n",
