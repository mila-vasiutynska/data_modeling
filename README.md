# data_modeling
Built an ETL pipeline in Python to preprocess and denormalize raw music streaming event data, then designed and implemented a query-driven data model in Apache Cassandra. Created optimized tables based on specific access patterns, using appropriate partition and clustering keys to enable efficient, scalable reads without joins or filtering.
